# JS201

Nashville Software School quiz using RequireJS to input family member's names, ages, genders and skills and post them to a firebase database. To work with the code:


##Clone the repo

    mkdir ~/projects && cd ~/projects
   git clone https://github.com/lynnsamuelson/movie-history.git

##Go to the application root folder and start the server.

    cd ~/projects/movie-history
    http-server ./ 

##Making your own Firebase Database

To have a database that you can access, go to:

    https://www.firebaseio.com/
    
and make an account.

Now you can open your browser and go to http://localhost:8081 (or whichever port it reports it is using).
